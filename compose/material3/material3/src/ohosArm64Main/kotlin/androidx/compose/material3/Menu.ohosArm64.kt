 * <a href="https://m3.material.io/components/menus/overview" class="external" target="_blank">Material Design dropdown menu</a>.
 *
 * Menus display a list of choices on a temporary surface. They appear when users interact with a
 * button, action, or other control.
 *
 * ![Dropdown menu image](https://developer.android.com/images/reference/androidx/compose/material3/menu.png)
 *
 * A [DropdownMenu] behaves similarly to a [Popup], and will use the position of the parent layout
 * to position itself on screen. Commonly a [DropdownMenu] will be placed in a [Box] with a sibling
 * that will be used as the 'anchor'. Note that a [DropdownMenu] by itself will not take up any
 * space in a layout, as the menu is displayed in a separate window, on top of other content.
 *
 * The [content] of a [DropdownMenu] will typically be [DropdownMenuItem]s, as well as custom
 * content. Using [DropdownMenuItem]s will result in a menu that matches the Material
 * specification for menus. Also note that the [content] is placed inside a scrollable [Column],
 * so using a [LazyColumn] as the root layout inside [content] is unsupported.
 *
 * [onDismissRequest] will be called when the menu should close - for example when there is a
 * tap outside the menu, or when the back key is pressed.
 *
 * [DropdownMenu] changes its positioning depending on the available space, always trying to be
 * fully visible. Depending on layout direction, first it will try to align its start to the start
 * of its parent, then its end to the end of its parent, and then to the edge of the window.
 * Vertically, it will try to align its top to the bottom of its parent, then its bottom to top of
 * its parent, and then to the edge of the window.
 *
 * An [offset] can be provided to adjust the positioning of the menu for cases when the layout
 * bounds of its parent do not coincide with its visual bounds.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.samples.MenuSample
 *
 * Example usage with a [ScrollState] to control the menu items scroll position:
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.samples.MenuWithScrollStateSample
 *
 * @param expanded whether the menu is expanded or not
 * @param onDismissRequest called when the user requests to dismiss the menu, such as by tapping
 * outside the menu's bounds
 * @param modifier [Modifier] to be applied to the menu's content
 * @param offset [DpOffset] from the original position of the menu. The offset respects the
 * [LayoutDirection], so the offset's x position will be added in LTR and subtracted in RTL.
 * @param scrollState a [ScrollState] to used by the menu's content for items vertical scrolling
 * @param properties [PopupProperties] for further customization of this popup's behavior
 * @param content the content of this dropdown menu, typically a [DropdownMenuItem]
