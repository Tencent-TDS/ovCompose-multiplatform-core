/**
 * <a href="https://m3.material.io/components/menus/overview" class="external" target="_blank">Material Design Exposed Dropdown Menu</a>.
 *
 * Menus display a list of choices on a temporary surface. They appear when users interact with a
 * button, action, or other control.
 *
 * Exposed dropdown menus, sometimes also called "spinners" or "combo boxes", display the currently
 * selected item in a text field to which the menu is anchored. In some cases, it can accept and
 * display user input (whether or not itâ€™s listed as a menu choice), in which case it may be used to
 * implement autocomplete.
 *
 * ![Exposed dropdown menu image](https://developer.android.com/images/reference/androidx/compose/material3/exposed-dropdown-menu.png)
 *
 * The [ExposedDropdownMenuBox] is expected to contain a [TextField] (or [OutlinedTextField]) and
 * [ExposedDropdownMenu][ExposedDropdownMenuBoxScope.ExposedDropdownMenu] as content. The
 * [menuAnchor][ExposedDropdownMenuBoxScope.menuAnchor] modifier should be passed to the text field.
 *
 * An example of a read-only Exposed Dropdown Menu:
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.samples.ExposedDropdownMenuSample
 *
 * An example of an editable Exposed Dropdown Menu:
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.samples.EditableExposedDropdownMenuSample
 *
 * @param expanded whether the menu is expanded or not
 * @param onExpandedChange called when the exposed dropdown menu is clicked and the expansion state
 * changes.
 * @param modifier the [Modifier] to be applied to this ExposedDropdownMenuBox
 * @param content the content of this ExposedDropdownMenuBox, typically a [TextField] and an
 * [ExposedDropdownMenu][ExposedDropdownMenuBoxScope.ExposedDropdownMenu]. The
 * [menuAnchor][ExposedDropdownMenuBoxScope.menuAnchor] modifier should be passed to the text field
 * for proper menu behavior.
