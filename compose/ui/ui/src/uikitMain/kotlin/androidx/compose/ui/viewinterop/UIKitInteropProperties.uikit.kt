/**
 * Properties that are used to configure the behavior of the interop view.
 *
 * @property interactionMode The strategy on how the touches are processed when user interacts with
 * the interop view.
 *
 * @property isNativeAccessibilityEnabled Indicates whether a11y services should traverse the
 * native view itself, instead of parsing Compose semantics properties.
 *
 * If this Composable is within a modifier chain that merges the semantics of its children (such as
 * `Modifier.clickable`), the merged subtree data will be ignored in favor of the native
 * UIAccessibility resolution for the interop view. For example, Compose Button containing
 * [UIKitView] will be invisible for accessibility services, only the interop view will be
 * accessible. In other words, this property taints the whole merged subtree with the native
 * accessibility resolution.
 *
 * To avoid this behavior, set [isNativeAccessibilityEnabled] to `false` and use custom
 * [Modifier.semantics] for `Button` to make the information associated with this view accessible.
 *
 * If there are multiple [UIKitView] or [UIKitViewController] with [isNativeAccessibilityEnabled]
 * set to `true` in the merged tree, only the first one will be accessible.
 *
 * Consider using a single [UIKitView] or [UIKitViewController] with multiple views inside it if you
 * need multiple natively accessible views.
 *
 * In general, [isNativeAccessibilityEnabled] set to `true` is not recommended to use unless
 * you need rich accessibility capabilities of the interop view (such as web views).
 * Consider using [Modifier.semantics] instead.
