/**
 * Compose a [UIViewController] of class [T] into the UI hierarchy.
 *
 * @param factory The block creating the [T] to be composed.
 *
 * NOTE: [T] shouldn't be leaked outside and will be managed by Compose runtime efficiently.
 * Remembering [T] externally and passing it to be returned from [factory] can (and probably will)
 * lead to hilarious bugs in case [onReset] is not `null`.
 * @param modifier The modifier to be applied to the layout.
 * @param update A callback to be invoked every time the state it reads changes.
 * Invoked once initially and then every time the state it reads changes.
 * @param onRelease A callback invoked as a signal that the [T] has exited the
 * composition forever. Use it to release resources and stop jobs associated with [T].
 * @param onReset If not null, this callback is invoked when this composable node is
 * reused in the composition instead of being recreated. Use it to reset the state of [T] to
 * some blank state. This is a function that will be executed instead of [factory] if the node
 * containing [T] was reused. If null, [T] will not be reused, a new instance of [T] will be created
 * using [factory] every time this function enters the composition.
 * @property properties The properties configuring the behavior of [T]. Default value is
 * [UIKitInteropProperties.Default]
 *
 * @see UIKitInteropProperties
