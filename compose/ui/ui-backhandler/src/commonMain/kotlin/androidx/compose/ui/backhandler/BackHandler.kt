/**
 * An effect for handling predictive system back gestures.
 *
 * Calling this in your composable adds the given lambda to the BackGestureDispatcher.
 * The lambda passes in a Flow<BackEventCompat> where each
 * [BackEventCompat] reflects the progress of current gesture back. The lambda content should follow
 * this structure:
 * ```
 * PredictiveBackHandler { progress: Flow<BackEventCompat> ->
 *      // code for gesture back started
 *      try {
 *         progress.collect { backevent ->
 *              // code for progress
 *         }
 *         // code for completion
 *      } catch (e: CancellationException) {
 *         // code for cancellation
 *      }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If this is called by nested composables, if enabled, the inner most composable will consume the
 * call to system back and invoke its lambda. The call will continue to propagate up until it finds
 * an enabled BackHandler.
 *
 * @param enabled if this BackHandler should be enabled, true by default
 * @param onBack the action invoked by back gesture
