/**
 * Binds the browser window state to the given navigation controller.
 *
 * If `getBackStackEntryRoute` is null, then:
 *  1) if a browser url contains a destination route on a start then navigates to destination
 *  2) if a user puts a new destination route to the browser address field then navigates to the new destination
 *
 * If there is a custom `getBackStackEntryRoute` implementation,
 * then we don't have a knowledge how to parse urls to support direct navigation via browser address input.
 * In that case, it should be done on the app's side:
 * ```
 * window.addEventListener("popstate") { event ->
 *     event as PopStateEvent
 *     if (event.state == null) { // empty state means manually entered address
 *         val url = window.location.toString()
 *         navController.navigate(...)
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param navController The [NavController] instance to bind to browser window navigation.
 * @param getBackStackEntryRoute An optional function that returns the route to show for a given [NavBackStackEntry].
