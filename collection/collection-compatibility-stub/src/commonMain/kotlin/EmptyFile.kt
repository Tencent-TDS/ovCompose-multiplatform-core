// We prefer to have no source code here, but a module can't be empty.
// We use this module to publish a dumb klib to be provided to the compilation of user projects.
// It's needed because Kotlin tries to resolve the dependencies listed in klib manifest.
// There is an intention to drop this behaviour: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-61096/KLIB-Resolve-Drop-KLIB-resolve-inside-the-Kotlin-compiler
// The actual klib is published at androidx maven coordinates in Google maven.
// This module depends on the actual klib, so the module API will be available transitively.
