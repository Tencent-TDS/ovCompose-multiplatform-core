/**
 * This class represents a parallelogram (i.e. a quadrilateral with parallel sides), defined by its
 * [center], [width], [height], [rotation], and [shearFactor].
 *
 * Parameters of a [Parallelogram] are used to define a pair of vector semi-axes:
 * ```
 * u = {.5 * w * cos(Œ∏), .5 * w * sin(Œ∏)}
 * v = {.5 * h * (s * cos(Œ∏) - sin(Œ∏)), .5 * h * (s * sin(Œ∏) + cos(Œ∏))}
 * ```
 *
 * where `w` is the [width], `h` is the [height], `s` is the [shearFactor] and `Œ∏` is the angle of
 * [rotation]. From the semi-axes, we define the shape of the parallelogram as the set of all points
 * c + ùõº * u + ùõΩ * v, where `c` is the center, and `ùõº` and `ùõΩ` are real numbers in the interval
 * [-1, 1].
 *
 * Note: Java code should use the factory function Parallelogram.from*.
 *
 * A [Parallelogram] may have a positive or negative height; a positive height indicates that the
 * angle from the first semi-axis to the second will also be positive.
 *
 * A [Parallelogram] may have a positive or negative shear factor; a positive shear factor indicates
 * a smaller absolute angle between the semi-axes (the shear factor is, in fact, the cotangent of
 * that angle).
 *
 * A [Parallelogram] may *not* have a negative width. If an operation on a parallelogram or the
 * construction of a parallelogram would result in a negative width, it is instead normalized, by
 * negating both the width and the height, adding œÄ to the angle of rotation, and normalizing
 * rotation to the range [0, 2œÄ).
 *
 * A [Parallelogram] may also be degenerate; that is, its [width] or [height], or both, may be zero.
 * Degenerate [Parallelogram]s may still have a non-zero [rotation] and/or [shearFactor]. A
 * [Parallelogram] that has both [width] and [height] of zero is effectively a point, and so
 * [rotation] and [shearFactor] do not affect the values of the axes or corners. A [Parallelogram]
 * that has either [width] or [height] of zero (but not both) is effectively a line segment, and so
 * is similarly unaffected by [shearFactor].
 *
 * More intuitively, you can think of the shape of the [Parallelogram], before taking the [center]
 * and [rotation] into account, like this:
 * ```
 *        s*h
 *      |------|__________
 *     ‚é°       /         /
 *     ‚é¢      /         /
 *     ‚é¢     /         /
 *   h ‚é¢    /         /
 *     ‚é¢   /         /
 *     ‚é¢  /         /
 *     ‚é£ /_________/
 *       |---------|
 *            w
 * ```
 *
 * Where `w` is the [width], `h` is the [height], and `s` is the [shearFactor]. You then rotate, and
 * translate such that the center is in the correct position.
 *
 * A few geometric objects can be represented as special cases of a [Parallelogram]. A generic
 * rectangle is a [Parallelogram] with [shearFactor] of zero. (It can be rotated with respect to the
 * axes, and hence might have a non-zero [rotation]). A [Box], an axis-aligned rectangle; is a
 * [Parallelogram] with both [rotation] and [shearFactor] of zero.
